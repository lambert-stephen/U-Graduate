# We Push to Master Final Project

**NOTE**
To run our application, go to the following link:
TestRun2-env.xptiszvwju.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com

This is our deployed application.

## Description

Overview: uGraduate is going to be an application that centralizes the current
in place systems students use to register. Students currently use 3 different
applications/systems to register for a semester. uAchieve, Register XE,
and uAdvise. All of the systems are not consistent and they are not centered
around the user experience. uGraduate will allow students to register, drop
classes, visually see all required courses through graduation in a tree like
fashion, and see available resources. All access control will be done through
administrators that have the ability to not only drop/add students to classes,
but they will indicate whether or not a student passes or fails a class and
updates the GUI accordingly.

## Deliverables for checkpoint 2

Have Hibernate and MySQL set up with a good amount of toy data we can use for querying.
We should at least have the following amount of toy data
50 students with all of their credentials
2 different colleges with 2 majors per college and 10 classes for each major
20 classes with class names, times and seat information
2 admins

Our app should be able to open to a login page where we can choose if we are a student or user, We should be able to register and login as a Student, this information should be stored in our DB.All the student functionalities

-Class Functionalities for Students should be done and their CRUD test suite should be written. -if a student registers, their name and credentials should be added to our DB.
-student should be able to search for a class and return the proper query.
-students should be able to query unfinished classes and results should be displayed to user
-students should be able to query classes they have already completed
-if a student unregisters, their name and credentials should be removed from our DB
The functionalities listed above under Students will be what our tests are checking for. Basic CRUD tests should be written for the students' class.

Fabian - mess around with Spring Security and configure things as needed. Still unsure of how to fully use Spring security but will have more detailed Spring security actions by checkpoint 4. Work on IAM configurations and learn how to do that. Will try to get those configurations up and running.

## Deliverables for checkpoint 3
Deployment Notes
- Security progress: Configured spring security to only accept roles signified in the SecurityConfig.java class. Only
people with the role "ADMIN" and "STUDENT" can log in. Spring security puts it all on lockdown. Our database has
a schema that use a master record of all users. There is a one to many join between users and authorities. Authorities
has a value "ROLE_USERROLE" and it can be "STUDENT" or "ADMIN". Redirects are then sent according to roles.

**NOTE: I spent too much time figuring out the workings of Spring Security and how to properly configure it. I even
pushed all throughout spring break. I was not able to get .env and secrets to work so at the moment I have them
saved in the code. Will be changing that for next deployment.
- How to Deploy:
- Step 1: Download our directory and open up src\main\resources\applications.properties. set spring.datasource.url to
jdbc:mysql://test-database.cmuqwxmahqss.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com/test?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
There is a username and password right under that. Change that to
username: admin
password: 12345678
Run a "mvn clean package" on the cmd line and this should create a file under the target directory.
(in intellij it created it under master/target). This file was SNAP_SHOT.war. Don't user the .war.original.

- Step 2: Log in to your aws account and go to the dashboard that has all the services. Click on Elastic
Beanstalk. You are going to create a new environment, click on new environment button and leave web server environment
default. go to the next page. Add an application name, environment name (to whatever you want), choose platform
as TOMCAT. The next section will then have you upload your own code (under the same page of application code). local
and upload the war file you recently created. It will upload for about a few minutes. And go on to the next page to
deploy. This part will take a while (took me 10min).
NOTES OF THE APP.
Login to the app first by using username: admin | password: admin. Here you can add students, search them and add
sections. Adding a student will create a user and allow login access. Adding a section will link students with
that required major.

Try this.

Add new student. Name: Whatever you want. last name: whatever you want. Major to whatever you want.
Click submit. Save the username and password it gives. Now go to add section. Add a section. Enter
a class name. Leave professor blank (will implement later) and pick the course that corresponds to the major
you selected earlier. submit.

Then go to localhost:8080/logout. logout.

Login with that credentials you got from the first username you created. Click on the first hyperlink. (Second one
is broken) and it will make a get request of all the courses associated with that user.   

## Deliverables for checkpoint 4

Functionality is ALMOST complete. We prioritized a few things over what was originally proposed. It was originally proposed
that the app would focus on the student side of things (what they can see and register for, etc) but the admin side of things
is what has been built. So far, an admin can add a student and attach a major to him/her. An admin can add a section 
and attach a major or a professor to the section. The admin can also attach professors to sections (without creating a new section or professor).

Now on the student side, the student can see all required sections that has the same major as them. only a cs student can see cs classes. 
This is all done through inner joins on hibernate and spring. 

Fabian - Worked on most of the hibernate queries. Worked on most of the MySql queries and created the design patterns of the framework
Hanna - 
Jonathan - 
Stephen - 

The student should have been be able to query and register for classes. Still not done. But Fabian will get that done by next checkpoint. 
Hashing password in the db is also something that was meant to get done way sooner. 

Plan of attack for 5 is just zeroing on the last functionality we want to have and making sure we don't break anything. The student
side needs to get finished, but the admin side is almost done and had most of the functionality so getting the student side done should't be
too bad. 

Fabian - in charge of finishing functionality touches. 
Hanna - 
Jonathan - 
Stephen - 

Changes from original plan aren't substantial. We wanted to create a registration system. What we have right now is a registration 
system where you as an admin can add classes and professors and majors and students. As a student, its a registration where you can't
really take any action. But that is ok because it will be complete by the last deliverable. One thing that probably won't be added is
the "completed"/"in progress" capability. The hibernate queries were pretty bad to learn to begin with. To add two other entries to the db, 
plus entries to the entity, Service, DAO and other DAO design pattern classes and interfaces would be a nightmare. I did that 
once and had to rewrite the entire design pattern over again. It was a GREAT learning experience though. The reason why we have the SOLID principles
makes so much more sense. Had the design patterns been more decoupled, and had I coded to the interface, I would not have needed to rewrite 
things when other semi-unrelated objects needed to change. Planning and using UML diagrams and use case diagrams is also something I am going 
to start doing from now on... 


## Deliverables for final project

Functionality
- Students should be able to search for a specific class
- Students should be able to register for a course. 

## Specialization deliverables

Fabian - Secure management of the registration system. IAM customization for Admin roles only. String access control. 2F auth for admins. Extensive logging. Credential-less storing, and other related security vulnerabilities within the scope of the registration system

Jon - An interactive Class tree map that displays classes completed, in progress, and finished. Will make a very user experience centered design that focuses on user recognition (rather than recall) and really adhere to the Nielson 10 design heuristics

# Installation

AWS Deployment Instructions:
- Intall Intellij or Eclipse
- Import this project folder as a MAVEN project
- Run mvn clean package. This will create a directory called target and add folders and files inside. Inside the file, there is a .war file (not the .war.original). This is the file that will be used to deploy on the server
- On AWS, create a new instance of Elastic Beanstalk and upload the .war file from the project directory
- Good to go
